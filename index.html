        <p>An Aquatic mammal within the <a href="Cetacea.html">Infraorder Cetacea</a>. Currently there are 49 dolphin and porpoise species which are grouped into six families: the oceanic dolphin family is by far the largest with 38 members; the
          porpoise family has seven members; and there are four river dolphin families, each containing just one species. However, classification is not an exact science and as more information and discoveries come to light, deliberations will
          continue and some dolphin species are likely to be further split into more than one species and/or subspecies.</p>
