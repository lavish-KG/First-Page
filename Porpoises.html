    <h1>Porpoises</h1>
    <p>Porpoises are marine mammals and are part of the cetacean species which also includes dolphins and whales.So far there are currently around 6 known species of porpoises in existence today.
    <p>Out of all three groups porpoises are the smallest of the cetaceans with an average size of between 5 – 8 ft. in length and an average weight of between 100 – 200 lbs., however it is possible for some porpoises to weigh in excess of 400 lbs when fully grown.
    Although porpoises are able to dive to depths of over 650 ft. when searching for food they usually stay at or near the surface of the water.
    When startled or surprised some species of porpoise are known to reach speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour in order to help them escape from a potential threat or predator.</p>
